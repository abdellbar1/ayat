# Quran Navigator: A Quran Data Science Project

Welcome to the Quran Data Science project! Our mission is to enhance the understanding of Quranic words using data science methodologies. This project involves extracting words from the Quran, identifying their root forms, analyzing occurrences across different verses and chapters, and integrating additional contextual information such as tafsirs and Arabic dictionary explanations. Additionally, we aim to visualize these insights through heat maps and other graphical representations, providing users with a comprehensive tool for studying the Quranic text.

## Project Scope and Objectives:

### Scope:
- Data Extraction and Processing
- Database Development
- API Development
- Graph Database Representation
- Integration with Quran Web Platform
- Visualization and Summarization

### Objectives:
1. Develop scripts for data extraction and processing.
2. Build a database structure to store Quranic words and related data.
3. Create an API to interact with the collected data.
4. Transition the database structure to a graph database model.
5. Develop a plugin for integration with the KSU Quran web platform.
6. Implement visualization tools for exploring Quranic word data.

## Roadmap of Execution:

### Current Status:
- **Data Processing:** Words and occurrences have been processed through root words.
- **API Development:** An API has been created to interact with the collected data. It is hosted on Heroku but is still buggy and incomplete.

### Future Projection:
1. **Database Enhancement:** Improve the database structure to accommodate additional contextual information.
2. **API Refinement:** Fix bugs and complete the API to provide comprehensive functionality.
3. **Graph Database Implementation:** Transition the database to a graph database model for efficient representation of relationships.
4. **Integration with Quran Web Platform:** Develop a plugin for seamless integration with the KSU Quran web platform.
5. **Visualization Tools:** Implement visualization tools for graphical representation of Quranic word data.
